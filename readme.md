Welcome to Whack a Troll, a game based off of a well known carnival game known as Whack a Mole. This game uses the lastest version of jQuery to manipulate certain aspects of the game. I started with designing the layout, from there I spend the most time working on the gameboard itself before making it interactive. The most difficult process of this project was making the trolls move to different holes. The goal of the game is to score as many points as you can in 60 seconds. Good luck!
